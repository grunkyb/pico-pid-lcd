# pico-pid-lcd
Make a Raspberry Pi Pico into a graphical PID controller

## Requirements

### For the controller
- Raspberry Pi Pico with male headers
- [Pico 0.96" LCD with buttons](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Pico-LCD-0.96)
- BME280 sensor with I2C connection
- Jumper wires

### For the heater
- N-channel power MOSFET with logic-level gating (e.g., [IRLB8721](https://thepihut.com/products/n-channel-power-mosfet))
- DC power supply
- Resistive heating elements (e.g., an [electric heating pad](https://thepihut.com/products/electric-heating-pad-10cm-x-5cm))
- Female DC 2.1mm jack for power adapter (depending on power supply wiring)
